# Food Delivery Landing Page

This is a Expense Tracker built with ReactJs/TypeScript. You can login and register. It has authentication and authorization. Also you can add new expense category and new expense record. It has restful api integration for data and authentication and authorization. It is not responsive yet. There is global state management with redux. And finally dahsboard's chart and expense cards static yet but I'll fix this asap.

### Here is the live demo
